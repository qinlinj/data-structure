/**
 * Segment Tree Implementation with Lazy Propagation
 *
 * CONCEPT AND PRINCIPLES:
 * A Segment Tree is a tree data structure used for storing information about intervals or segments.
 * It allows querying which segments contain a given point and updating segments in logarithmic time.
 *
 * Key advantages of Segment Trees:
 * 1. Efficient range queries - O(log n) time complexity
 * 2. Efficient range updates - O(log n) with lazy propagation
 * 3. Versatile - can be adapted for various problems (sum, min, max, gcd, etc.)
 * 4. Space efficient - requires O(n) space for n elements
 *
 * Basic operations:
 * - Build: Construct the segment tree from an array - O(n)
 * - Query: Find result for a range [l, r] - O(log n)
 * - Update: Update a single element or a range - O(log n)
 *
 * Lazy Propagation:
 * This optimization delays the propagation of updates to children nodes until necessary.
 * Without lazy propagation, updating a range would require O(n log n) time.
 * With lazy propagation, range updates can be performed in O(log n) time.
